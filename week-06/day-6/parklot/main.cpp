	//Create a 3 dimensional vector of our car class, that will represent a "parking house"

		//3 dimension: "parking house"
	//Make this parking house 4*4*8 (4*4 platform on 8 floors), then fill it with cars! :)
	//Give these cars a random type from our car type vector!
	//Give these cars a random color from our color vector!
	//Give these cars a random plate number!
	//Make sure there are no duplicates in car plates!
	//Print out how much "SÃ¡rga"-"Zsiguli" we have, with their position and platenumber in the parking house!
	//At the end empty the parking house!
